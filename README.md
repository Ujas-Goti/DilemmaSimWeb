Project Title: Ethical Dilemma Simulator
Technology Used: C# with ASP.NET Core Razor Pages
Description:
 The Ethical Dilemma Simulator is an interactive web application that presents users with 10 real-life moral scenarios. 
 For each scenario, the user selects one of three choices, each affecting their honesty and empathy scores. 
 After all dilemmas are completed, a Google Pie Chart visually summarizes their moral alignment. 
 The project demonstrates key C# concepts including variables, arithmetic operations, selection statements, subprograms, and object-oriented programming.
